Welcome and We are proud to present a video tutorial 
on this system "Voice command controller for IT Laboratory"

so to get started you need an account. if you already have an account just enter it and log in.
If not, follow this steps.
first you need to login using the default username "voice" and the default password "command"
this will bring us to the registration form for registering new professors.

So let us now register an account.
my username is "joshua"
password is "joshua"
retype password "joshua"
lastname "Abrenica"
first name "Mark Joshua"
Middle name "Rivera"
gender "Male"

so now i'm finished in entering my account details and now click next.

Now enter your schedule of your subjects.
click "save"
then click "continue"

so the system tells us that we are first time users and it is recommended to train the speech recognition engine
<stop>

<record>
Network settings.
network settings allows you to rename each client's "word call" so that you can call their names and able to control them using voice commands
phrases like "pc1 shutdown unit" or "pc3 lock unit" to give commands to a specific computer

File settings this is for opening of files. example let's register a lecture file.
so that if i say "server open lecture1" the system will open this file located in this folder

keyword settings.
this is for shortcut keys using voice command. examples are "select-all" that's control-A
or undo. you can add more shortcuts here.

ok now the system will teach us the basics of voice commands. let's follow the instruction

so now the tutorial is finished we are here in the dashboard or main menu. next time we log in, we will redirected here.
so you can access all the previous configuration settings in here. like network setting, application setting, keyword setting and word setting.

so let's first discuss about "my class"

so in here you have the ability to register student. let's try to register a student.
and now the students registered will be listed here.

so before we proceed let's first register some students in the client side

<stop>

<record>
So first you need to register your account as a student first. The default password is username: "student" and password: "student"
here you'll need to provide your account information.
ok now let's log in.
so now we're loggedin as a student, a timer indicator here for indicating our laboratory time and in here the instructions for saving the activity

so if the professor set's a time limit example "60 minutes" or 10 minutes, this will change to the time limit set by the professor

<stop>

<record>
The timer settings allows you to set time for each computer laboratory activity or activity by batch.
so let's set the time to let's say 7 minutes.
now let's take a look at the client side for any changes
<stop>

<junar's pc>
<login>
<record>
<<system changes timer>>
<after 5 seconds>
<stop>
supposed dub for that "now you see that the time changed and was set to 7 minutes because the professor set it. Now let's take a look of the student monitoring module

<record>
so now we we'll start the timer.
so click "start voice command"
and now say "server start time"

<stop>

<record>
now let's see the student activities while they are doing their activities
first click "start voice command"
so now i'll just say "start student monitoring"
so we have only one student connected. the rest of these computers are registered but not connected that is why they are black screens
we can control these clients using this graphical user interface 
or using voice commands.
for locking i'll just say
"all lock unit"
for specific computer for example pc1, i'll just say "pc1 lock unit"
the same pattern applies for shutting down, unlocking, and force logout.
i can also go to the student monitoring module by clicking this icon.
so next we'll talk about the student saving their activities. but first the professor needs to open their application. so let's open
visual studio within the client using voice.
click "start voice command"
say "all open visual-studio"
so you see here in the student monitoring the visual studio opened.
Now let's take a look at the client side and start creating an activity

<stop>

<start>
so let's create a basic program.
so now i'm finished i can just log out and the system will send my activity to the server and also my attendance
now let's take a look at the attendance module and student's activities
<stop>

<start>
to view the attendance and the student's activities just click my class, and click student activity

so the folder in which the activity resides will open
<stop>

<start>
...
the account settings allows you to update your account like changing of passwords and correcting personal information.
...
<stop>

<start>
...
voice alternative module. this module is for learning voice commands and an alternative to using the wireless microphone headset.
use this if the voice recognition fails or if you want to know more voice commands.

<stop>
